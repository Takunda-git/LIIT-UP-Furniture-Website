# LIIT UP Furniture Website 🪑

LIIT UP is a modern, user-friendly furniture website designed as part of a personal project to demonstrate my understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The concept was inspired by the need to bring furniture shopping online — especially for customers living far from physical branches — by offering a digital solution where quality meets convenience.

## 🌟 Project Purpose

This website was created to:

- Apply and practice frontend web development skills (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Simulate a real-world ecommerce furniture site
- Solve common customer pain points in the furniture industry

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – for structure
- **CSS3** – for layout and visual design
- **JavaScript** – for basic interactivity and enhancements
